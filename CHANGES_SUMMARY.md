# Changes Summary

## ScrollSidebar Component Updates

### What was changed:
1. **Removed all fancy animations** - No more pulsing dots, glowing effects, or progress bars
2. **Made sidebar smaller** - Reduced overall size and bar lengths
3. **Added small static bars** - Added divider bars between main section bars (non-clickable)
4. **Made bars straight** - All bars are simple horizontal lines (1px height)

6. **White color** - All bars are white (with varying opacity)
7. **Fully responsive** - Visible on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Uses `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints for responsive sizing

9. **Simplified tooltips** - Only shown on desktop (lg+), simpler design
