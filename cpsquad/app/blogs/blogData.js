    title: "Dynamic Programming Patterns Every CP Should Know",
    excerpt: "Master the most common dynamic programming patterns used in competitive programming contests. From knapsack to digit DP, we cover it all.",
    content: `
      <h2>Introduction to Dynamic Programming</h2>
      <p>Dynamic Programming (DP) is one of the most important techniques in competitive programming. It's used to solve optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Linear DP</h2>
      <p>The simplest form of DP where the state depends on previous states in a linear fashion.</p>
      <pre><code>// Example: Fibonacci sequence
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]</code></pre>
      
      <h2>2. Knapsack DP</h2>
      <p>Used for optimization problems involving selecting items with constraints.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>0/1 Knapsack:</strong> Each item can be taken at most once</li>
        <li><strong>Unbounded Knapsack:</strong> Items can be taken multiple times</li>
        <li><strong>Bounded Knapsack:</strong> Each item has a limited quantity</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>3. Interval DP</h2>
      <p>Problems involving intervals or ranges, often solved by considering all possible ways to divide the interval.</p>
      <pre><code>// Example: Matrix Chain Multiplication
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + cost(i,k,j)) for all k</code></pre>
      
      <h2>4. Tree DP</h2>
      <p>DP on trees where we compute values for subtrees and combine them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Root the tree at any node</li>
        <li>Compute DP values for children first</li>
        <li>Combine children's values to get parent's value</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>5. Digit DP</h2>
      <p>Used for problems involving constraints on digits of numbers.</p>
      <p>State usually includes: current position, tight constraint, and problem-specific parameters.</p>
      
      <h2>Practice Problems</h2>
      <p>Start with these classic problems:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Coin Change (Linear DP)</li>
        <li>Longest Increasing Subsequence (Linear DP)</li>
        <li>0/1 Knapsack (Knapsack DP)</li>
        <li>Matrix Chain Multiplication (Interval DP)</li>
        <li>Tree Diameter (Tree DP)</li>
      </ol>

    content: `
      <h2>Introduction to Graph Theory</h2>
      <p>Graph theory is fundamental to competitive programming. Understanding graphs and their algorithms is crucial for solving many complex problems efficiently.</p>
      
      <h2>Graph Representation</h2>
      <h3>Adjacency List</h3>
      <pre><code>vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
adj[u].push_back(v); // Add edge u -> v</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Adjacency Matrix</h3>
      <pre><code>vector<vector<int>> adj(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
adj[u][v] = 1; // Add edge u -> v</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Basic Traversal Algorithms</h2>
      <h3>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h3>
      <p>Used for exploring graphs, finding connected components, and detecting cycles.</p>
      <pre><code>void dfs(int node, vector<bool>& visited) {
    visited[node] = true;
    for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            dfs(neighbor, visited);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h3>
      <p>Perfect for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs.</p>
      <pre><code>void bfs(int start) {
    queue<int> q;
    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    q.push(start);
    visited[start] = true;
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Shortest Path Algorithms</h2>
      <h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>
      <p>For single-source shortest paths with non-negative weights.</p>
      
      <h3>Bellman-Ford Algorithm</h3>
      <p>Handles negative weights and detects negative cycles.</p>
      
      <h3>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</h3>
      <p>All-pairs shortest paths for small graphs.</p>
      
      <h2>Advanced Topics</h2>
      <h3>Minimum Spanning Tree</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kruskal's Algorithm:</strong> Sort edges and use Union-Find</li>
        <li><strong>Prim's Algorithm:</strong> Greedy approach with priority queue</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Network Flows</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maximum Flow:</strong> Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum Cut:</strong> Max-flow min-cut theorem</li>
        <li><strong>Bipartite Matching:</strong> Special case of maximum flow</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Practice Strategy</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Master basic traversal algorithms first</li>
        <li>Solve shortest path problems</li>
        <li>Practice MST and topological sorting</li>

    title: "Interview with ICPC World Finalist",
    excerpt: "Exclusive interview with our club alumnus who made it to the ICPC World Finals. Learn about their journey, preparation strategies, and advice.",
    content: `
      <h2>Meet Our Champion</h2>
      <p>Today we're interviewing <strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong>, a CP Squad alumnus who recently competed at the ICPC World Finals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Alex's team finished in the top 20 globally!</p>
      
      <h2>The Journey to World Finals</h2>
      <p><strong>Q: Tell us about your path to the World Finals.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> It started three years ago when I joined CP Squad as a freshman. I was intimidated at firstâ€”everyone seemed so much better than me. But the club's supportive environment helped me improve rapidly. We practiced together every week, participated in local contests, and gradually worked our way up through regionals.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Q: What was the most challenging part of your preparation?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Team coordination was harder than individual skill development. In ICPC, you have three people sharing one computer, so you need to strategize who codes what and when. We spent months perfecting our teamwork and communication.</p>
      
      <h2>Preparation Strategy</h2>
      <p><strong>Q: How did you structure your practice routine?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> We had a systematic approach:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Individual practice:</strong> 2-3 hours daily on platforms like Codeforces and AtCoder</li>
        <li><strong>Team practice:</strong> 3 mock contests per week using past ICPC problems</li>
        <li><strong>Topic focus:</strong> One week dedicated to specific algorithms (DP, graphs, geometry)</li>
        <li><strong>Contest analysis:</strong> Detailed review of every contest we participated in</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>The World Finals Experience</h2>
      <p><strong>Q: How was the actual World Finals?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Incredible and nerve-wracking! The competition hall was massive, with teams from 60+ countries. The problems were extremely challengingâ€”we solved 5 out of 12, which was enough for a decent ranking. The atmosphere was electric, and meeting competitors from around the world was inspiring.</p>
      
      <h2>Advice for Current Students</h2>
      <p><strong>Q: What advice would you give to current CP Squad members?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Several key points:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Start early:</strong> The earlier you begin, the more time you have to develop skills</li>
        <li><strong>Practice consistently:</strong> Daily practice beats occasional marathon sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Learn from failures:</strong> Every wrong submission teaches you something</li>
        <li><strong>Build a team early:</strong> Team chemistry takes time to develop</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy the process:</strong> The journey is more important than the destination</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p><strong>Q: What's next for you?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Alex:</strong> I'm starting my software engineering career at Microsoft, but I'll stay involved with CP Squad as a mentor. I want to help the next generation of competitive programmers achieve their goals.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Final words:</strong> "Believe in yourself and trust the process. Every great competitive programmer started as a beginner. With dedication and the right community support, amazing things are possible!"</p>
